## Purpose:

#### This Website helps you to keep track of all the things in your life you don't want to do.

#### So next time somemone wants you to deactivate your ad-blocker, wants to talk about our lord and saviour Cthulu or wants you to take part in a survey, you can state with full confidence

# _I'm sorry, but that's on my notToDo-list_
